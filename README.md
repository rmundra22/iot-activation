# Welcome to IoT Activation of Telef√≥nica

![pic](tutorials/pictures/miscellaneous/IOT_Activation.png)

We welcome you to The IoT World.
These tutorials are designed to assist you in your beginnings and resolve any doubts that may arise you.
With this guide you will discover the advantages of IoT devices.
You'll learn how to collect data online, remotely control your devices and automate deployment processes.
IoT will allow you to reduce costs and offer a better service, while improving quality.

Along with this guide, you will also have received a box with a lot of gadgets that that you probably don't identify. 
Don't worry, you will be playing with it in no time!

To start you can choose between several kits, those are the first step to achieve your business goal.
The Raspberry and Arduino are very versatile devices that will offer you endless possibilities, 
but take it easy... You'll never walk alone!

They may seem small, but the possibilities are immense!!

We will also teach you different technologies so you can decide which one works best for your business.
