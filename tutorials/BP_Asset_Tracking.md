# What is Asset Tracking?

Today, geo-location of devices is one of the most demanded skills in the IoT world.
This growing demand arises from the need to be able to locate our devices at any moment.

Utilities like locating our car in the parking lot of a shopping center, or simply finding our keys in the lounge of our house.7
Tells us that these new utilities will be even more demanded by consumers in the coming years.

Now let's be honest, not only do customers benefit from these new technologies, 
more and more companies are investing money and effort in being able to locate the location of their assets.
It is not only necessary to know the state of our devices, also to be able to locate them quickly.

## Why do we need Asset Tracking?

The technology has greatly facilitated us to have GPS modules easy to install in any device, 
but for small devices of low consumption, not only cause us an increase in the final price of the 
device but also an increase in the size that has cost so much to reduce, including the payment of a higher battery consumption.
