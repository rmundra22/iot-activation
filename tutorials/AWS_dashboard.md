{
	"reported": {
		"raw": {
			"sensor1": 3,
			"text1": "TZEUXBZPZN",
			"sensor2": 76,
			"location": {
				"latitude": 40.431948,
				"longitude": -3.666315
			},
			"time": "Thu Mar 21 12:39:24 2019"
		}
	}

```

You can load it from this [file](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iot-activation/tree/master/scripts/AWS_Dashboard/freeboard.json)

In the same way, you can export your freeboard. It is an important step to recover your configuration. 
It is lost every time you refresh the web.

Be careful, you don't share this file. It contains your account access key.

### Protect you account

If you need share your dashboard configuration file, the best way to protect your account 
is generate a new user whit a specific policy. This is possible through IAM console.

Go to AWS IAM console / **Policy** / **Create Policy**

You can define permissions using a json structure.
Design a specific rule for your user, in which it is only allowed:
- connect as a client
- Subscribe to a specific topic

Use the following template by completing the information with your **AWS_account**, **region** and **Name_topic** 

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iot:Connect",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:region:AWS_account:client/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["iot:Receive"],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:region:AWS_account:topic/Name_topic"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:region:AWS_account:topicfilter/Name_topic"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Click on **Review policy**

And click on **Create policy**

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_IAM_Policies_create_done.png)

The next step is to link this policy to your new user

Go to AWS IAM console / **Users** / **Add User**

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_IAM_Users_create.png)

Select your user name and choose a user for programmatic access. 
This option generates a new user with access to the account using a password.

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_IAM_Users_create_config1.png)

Attach the policy created in the previous step.

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_IAM_Users_create_config2.png)

Review it

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_IAM_Users_create_config3.png)

And click on **Create user**
