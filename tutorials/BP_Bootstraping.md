# What is Bootstraping?

If we told you that your device could be anything you wanted, we wouldn't be telling you anything you didn't already know. 

But if we tell you now that your device may be something different depending on the SIM you use.
Would it change anything?

This could be very helpful, if you control a wide variety of devices.

IoT-Activation offers you this possibility!!

Imagine making all your devices completely the same and configuring their operation only through the connection they use. 
In case of failure, you will only need to replace the old SIM in your new device. 
Easy, isn't it?
