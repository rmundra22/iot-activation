or simply select one or several to activate the bottom menu

In the image above you can check the current status of your SIMs within their life cycle.

Some of them may be deactivated, and you may need to change their status. In the next step we will show you how to check that a SIM is operational.

If you do not know the APN through which your SIM has to be connected, 
you can check it in this section.

##### Traffic consumption control

# How to get started with your SIM

1. First of all, your SIM must be [assigned to a subscription group](#assign-subscription-group)
2. In order for a SIM to be operational, it must be in [activated state](#change-life-cycle-state)
3. And lastly you must make sure that the SIM has the [data traffic activated](#activate-data-traffic)

There are many more options and services available for your SIM, 
(#how-its-made)

##### learn about life cycle state
In order for a SIM to be operational, it must be activated. follow the diagram below

![pic](pictures/Kite/Kite_interface_SIM_LifeCycle.png)

- **Inactive new**: initial state of any SIM card. The card will remain in this state until you 
assign a Subscription Group to it (including a commercial plan).

- **Test**: optional and available test for once the SIM card is assigned to a
Subscriptions group that takes into account that state in its commercial plan.
This state enables a limited traffic in order to prove the SIM card is functioning
correctly.

- **Activation ready**: previous state to Activated and state the SIM card changes to
once the time or the available traffic is consumed in the Test state.

- **Pending activation**: state similar to the previous one, but in this one the change
to the Activated state is done manually from Inventory.

- **Activated**: in this state the SIM card is fully operating, in condition of regular
traffic, and fees and service restrictions set up in the Subscriptions group through
the assigned commercial plan apply to it.

- **Deactivated**: state a SIM card can change to, typically when there is an anomaly
with the card. In this state, the SIM card does not have traffic but its permanence
can entail an associated fee. From this state, the card can be activated again
manually.

- **Suspended**: state a SIM card can be changed to, typically in cases of fraud or
unpaid, from any state it is in as long as it is not Retired. Leaving this state implies
returning to the state the SIM card was in before or to be Retired. Only the Service
Provider is authorized to perform manual transitions to and from this state.

- **Retired**: this shall always be the last state a SIM card shall be in before it is
retired. This state can only be reached if the card is suspended. Once in this state,
there is no going back to the previously defined states.

# What is Kite Platform API?
The Kite Platform offers you an API that allows you to integrate it with all your systems. 
It allows you to access all your data your data offering you various functionalities

## How to access Kite Platform API?

The API is available on the Internet, in the address m2m-api.telefonica.com,
through port 8010. Therefore, the services this API exhibits can be used from any
system having access to the Internet. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: 
All your API requests must use the HTTPS protocol. This guarantees the confidentiality of your data. 

To ensure your confidentiality, you will use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. 
This protocol allows you to establish a bidirectional communication between your systems and Kite.

This request is made through the use of a certificate and a private key for encryption,
these will be issued on demand and will be exclusive to you. Take good care of it! 
Remember that it is the gateway to all your SIM data.

### Extract your credentials files

If you have requested access to the Kite Platform API, the support team will have provided you with an encrypted file.pfx
containing both the key and the certificate for the SSL context of your connection. It will also provide you 
a password so that you can extract them.

It is important not to modify the name of the .pfx file until you extract the files.

1. Open a Linux Terminal and install openssl, if you do not have it installed.
This command allows you to decrypt your file
```
sudo apt-get install openssl
```
2. Extract the public key from Customer certificate **your_customer_certificate.pfx**
```
openssl pkcs12 -in your_customer_certificate.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out \
your_customer_certificate.cer -password pass:xxxxxxx
```
You will need the password provided by the Kite Platform Support Team

3. Extract the private key from the Customer certificate
```
openssl pkcs12 -in your_customer_certificate.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out \
your_customer_certificate.key -password pass:xxxxxxxx
```
also you will need your password here.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:  Remember, keep these new files in a safe place!!

### Access API using a command

The Curl command is used to transfer files from a server, it supports various protocols such as HTTP, FTP ...

There is an example about the access to the Commercial Plan API REST using the CURL command

```
sudo curl --cert ./your_customer_certificate.cer --key ./your_customer_certificate.key \
https://m2m-api.telefonica.com:8010/services/REST/GlobalM2M/ServicePacks/v2/r12/servicePack
```
