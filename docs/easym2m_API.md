## What is REST?

**Representational State Transfer (REST)** is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints 
to be used for creating Web services.
In a simpler definition, REST is any interface between systems that uses HTTP to obtain data 
or generate operations on that data. 

The following operations are the most used in a REST API:

- **GET**: Retrieve the URIs of the member resources of the collection resource in the response body.

- **POST**: Create a member resource in the collection resource using the instructions in the request body. 
The URI of the created member resource is automatically assigned and returned in the response Location header field.

## What is Postman?

Postman is a great tool when it comes to testing or using a REST API.
It offers a user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a lot of code. 

[Get Postman here!](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

One of the strengths of Postman is the collection creation and the possibility of use environment variables.

Postman allows you to define environments in which to define different values for the variables

### SIM update it

This method allows changes to specific SIM card attributes. It is necessary to enter the ICCID of the SIM card to be modified.

For prepaid products, only the following can be updated:

- Life cycle of the SIM card or status (lifeCycleStatus)
- Alias (alias)
- Alarm ID (idAlarm)

For post-paid products, in addition to the parameters that can be modified for prepaid SIM cards, it is also possible to change the following:
- Threshold for daily consumption (dailyConsumptionThreshold)
- Threshold for monthly consumption (monthlyConsumptionThreshold)

```
https://www.easym2m.eu/api/v2/customer/simcard/{{iccid}}
```
variables:

- **{{iccid}}** = SIM iccid number

body example:

```json
{
    "lifeCycleStatus" : "ACTIVE",
    "alias" : "MAD5149",
    "idAlarm" : "2898723948.3423"
