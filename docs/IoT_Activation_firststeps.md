The Connections page provides a representation of your SIM cards in one central location, 
regardless of Mobile Network Operator (MNO) identity, technology (GSM/CDMA) or its current location. 
A connection represents a cellular device and includes a carrier, rate plan, deployment status, data usage, location, roaming status, 
various identifiers (ICCID, IMEI, ESN, etc.), 
and other items that enables the cellular device to connect to the network.

It provides a unified global visibility and control over your cellular devices through the following capabilities:

- **Inventory Management:** Provides a detailed view of each cellular device including tagging, labeling, editing, searching, and batch update capabilities.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Enables functions to activate, deactivate, suspend, retire, and monitor event log history throughout the cellular deviceâ€™s lifecycle.
- **Usage Profile:** Provides the detailed usage by the cellular device per service (Voice, Data, SMS).
- **Device Locaion:** Provides a mobile-based global positioning solution.

In the inventory you will be able to visualize each one of the SIM cards and be able to access all the information related to the SIM.
To do so, click on the eye icon next to the ICCID

## Identify the APN 


Now your SIM is activated and you know everything necessary to make it work.

Your next step is to plug it into your device and start developing.


In addition to other values such as ICC or IMSI you must know the APN.

This is an address that your device will use to connect to the Internet.
