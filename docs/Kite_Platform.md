or you can access the SIM inventory, where you can locate and manage all your cards.

If you want to check the SIM details, you make double click on each of them.

Some of them may be deactivated, and you may need to change their status.

# How to get started with your SIM

1. First of all, your SIM must be [assigned to a subscription group](#assign-subscription-group)
2. In order for a SIM to be operational, it must be in [activated state](#change-life-cycle-state)
3. And lastly you must make sure that the SIM has the [data traffic activated](#activate-data-traffic)

There are many more options and [services available](#how-its-made) for your SIM

##### Learn about life cycle state

For connect your SIM need to be operational. for it, the SIM must be activated.
Follow the diagram below

![pic](pictures/Kite/Kite_interface_SIM_LifeCycle.png)

- **Inactive new**: initial state of any SIM card. The card will remain in this state until you 
assign a Subscription Group to it (including a commercial plan).

- **Test**: optional and available test for once the SIM card is assigned to a
Subscriptions group that takes into account that state in its commercial plan.
This state enables a limited traffic in order to prove the SIM card is functioning
correctly.

- **Activation ready**: previous state to Activated and state the SIM card changes to
once the time or the available traffic is consumed in the Test state.

- **Pending activation**: It is a state similar to the previous one, but in this one the change
to the Activated state is done manually from Inventory.

- **Activated**: In this state the SIM card is fully operating.

- **Deactivated**: In this state, the SIM card does not have traffic but its permanence
can entail an associated fee. From this state, the card can be activated again
manually.

- **Suspended**: This is used typically in cases of fraud or unpaid.

- **Retired**: This state will always be the last.. This state can only be reached if the card is suspended.
Once in this state, there is no going back.

# What is Kite Platform API?
The Kite Platform offers you an API (application program interface) that allows you to integrate it with all your systems.
It enables you to access all your data and it offers you news possibilities.

## How to access Kite Platform API?

The API is available in the address m2m-api.telefonica.com through the port 8010.
Therefore, this API services can be used from any system with Internet access.

&#x1F4CD;
All your API requests must use the HTTPS protocol. This guarantees the confidentiality of your data.

For this reason, you have to use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. 
This protocol allows you to establish a bidirectional communication between your systems and Kite.

This request is made through a certificate and a private key for encryption,
these files are exclusive to you. Take good care of it!
Remember that they are the gateway to all your SIM data.

### Extract your credentials files

If you requeste access to the Kite Platform API, the support team will provided you an encrypted file.pfx.
This file contain both the key and the certificate for the SSL context of your connection. They will also provide you
a password so that you can extract them.

&#x1F4CD;
It is important not to modify the name of the file.pfx until you extract the files.

1. Open a Linux Terminal and install openssl, if you do not have it installed.
This command allows you to decrypt your file
```
sudo apt-get install openssl
```
2. Extract the public key from Customer certificate **your_customer_certificate.pfx**
```
openssl pkcs12 -in your_customer_certificate.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out \
your_customer_certificate.cer -password pass:xxxxxxx
```
You will need the password provided by the Kite Platform Support Team

3. Extract the private key from the Customer certificate
```
openssl pkcs12 -in your_customer_certificate.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out \
your_customer_certificate.key -password pass:xxxxxxxx
```
also you will need your password here.

&#x1F4CD;
Remember, keep these new files in a safe place!!

### Access API using a command

The Curl command is used to transfer files from a server, it supports various protocols such as HTTP, FTP...

There is an example about the access to the Commercial Plan API REST using the CURL command

```
sudo curl --cert ./your_customer_certificate.cer --key ./your_customer_certificate.key \
https://m2m-api.telefonica.com:8010/services/REST/GlobalM2M/ServicePacks/v2/r12/servicePack
```

Learn how to use the API with the [Postman tool](Kite_Platform_API.md)
