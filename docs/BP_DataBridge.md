# What is The Data Bridge?

Data Bridge is a Python script. It can be deployed in any machine as a server.
It enables the connection between public clouds IoT Core services and UDP messages.
As a result, It will send back a message to the device with the publish code.


## Why do we need the Data Bridge?

Among the communication protocols, MQTT is well known due to it is really easy to use and it secures the communication through a TLS context, although from the energetic perspective it is quite aggressive. You shouldn't choose between security and battery... so the Data Bridge will make your day :). 

We wanna show you a energy consumption comparison: We sent 300 bytes packet with the same device and the result looks as follows ...

## What our bridge is already doing

- It accesses to Kite Platform to retrieve your custom information (the device name and topic)
- It received a UDP message and it publishes in the Cloud.
- It receives CoAP requests (GET/PUT) and connect to the Cloud
- It returns a message with the process result and commands

## What's it gonna do next?

- Compatibility with other clouds
- Deploy your Bridge in One Click

## What will you need?

- A Linux instance on a Public Cloud
- Python Interpreter
- [KITE Platform](Kite_Platform.md#access-step-by-step-using-the-curl-command) Certificates files
- IpSec Service provided by Telefonica [(IPsec)](BP_IPsec.md)

For the time being, If you use a SIM from the Thinx, you will not have access to the Kite Platform.
